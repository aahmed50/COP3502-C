## Project 2 | Recursion


Problem Description: Tree House <br> There are several trees (an even number) with treehouses in your backyard and you have pitched the bright idea to your parents that it would be fun to connect pairs of tree tops with a rope ladder, so that friends in one tree house could get to friends in another tree house without going back to the ground. 

<br>
Assume that the length of a rope ladder built between treetops located at (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is  

$\sqrt{(x_{i}-x_{j})^{2} + (y_{i}-y_{i})^{2}}$
 
<br>
Given the (x, y) positions of 2n treehouse, of all possible ways to create n pairs of distinct trees, find the minimum 
possible sum of distances between each tree in the pairs.
